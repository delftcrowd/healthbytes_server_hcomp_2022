Brief introduction of the project.

# Research Summary
Short summary of the problem, your approach, your implementation, and results.

In order to never face GitHub's size quotas, any data pertaining to the project should be hosted outside of the repository and linked in the README.

# Dependencies
You should always try to keep track of the dependencies of your project (e.g., Python packages) and their versions. That way anyone can re-create your development environment and reproduce your experiments.

Make sure to mention whether or not you used technologies like Docker, the required API keys for external services (if needed), the configuration files, and to provide Python's ```requirements``` file or the equivalent in other programming languages.

# Installation & Usage
You should provide instructions as to how to install and use your implementation.
